      { id: 3, text: "When I look back on something that happened, I tend to remember it as a story, including how things developed, rather than just as isolated facts." },
      { id: 4, text: "When I talk with others, I am very sensitive to their facial expressions and tone of voice, and I often feel I get more information from that than from their words alone." },
      { id: 5, text: "When I start something new, I prefer to roughly plan the overall flow or steps beforehand, rather than jumping in with no structure." },
      { id: 6, text: "Even when I cannot explain the details, I often make decisions based on a sense that “this direction feels right”, and it tends to work well." },

      { id: 7, text: "Even when I hear new information for the first time, I find it easy to understand if someone explains it to me carefully in words and logical steps." },
      { id: 8, text: "Before I take action, I often simulate the situation in my mind like a small movie and imagine how it will go." },
      { id: 9, text: "In everyday life, I sometimes imagine small events as if I were the main character in a story." },
      { id: 10, text: "On days when my emotions are strongly stirred, I feel that it affects my concentration and actions for a while, even if I try to switch my mood logically." },
      { id: 11, text: "I feel more comfortable in environments where there are some rules and procedures, rather than in places where everything is unpredictable." },
      { id: 12, text: "While listening to explanations, I sometimes suddenly get a feeling like “I know what the conclusion will be”, and later it turns out to be right." },

      { id: 13, text: "When I have vague feelings or complicated thoughts, writing them down as sentences on paper or on my phone often helps me整理 and feel relieved." },
      { id: 14, text: "When I trace my memories, it is easier to recall details by remembering the scene, the colors, or the layout of the place." },
      { id: 15, text: "When I hear about someone’s experience, I understand and remember it better when I see it as one story including background and motives." },
      { id: 16, text: "When I make decisions, I sometimes value whether something “feels right” more than purely logical reasons." },
      { id: 17, text: "When I work or study, I feel calmer and more focused if I decide, “I will do this first, and that next” and follow that order." },
      { id: 18, text: "Even if my ideas are still rough, I often sense that “this direction could become interesting”, and I enjoy following that feeling." },

      { id: 19, text: "When I learn new knowledge, I remember it better and understand it deeper when I explain it out loud in my own words." },
      { id: 20, text: "When I take notes, I care not only about the content but also about the layout, spacing, and visual balance on the page." },
      { id: 21, text: "When I explain something, I tend to talk in time order like, “first this happened, then this, and finally this”." },
      { id: 22, text: "When I watch a movie or drama, or listen to someone’s story, I easily empathize with the characters’ feelings, and the impression stays with me for a long time." },
      { id: 23, text: "Rather than vague instructions, I feel less stressed when I know specific information such as “what to do, by when, and how”." },
      { id: 24, text: "When I make plans, I feel it suits me better to decide roughly first and adjust flexibly later, rather than deciding everything in detail from the beginning." },

      { id: 25, text: "When I listen to conversations or read texts, I often pay attention to subtle wording differences to guess the speaker’s real intention." },
      { id: 26, text: "When I see documents that use colors, icons, or diagrams, I naturally understand faster and focus more easily." },
      { id: 27, text: "When I explain my feelings or situations, I often use comparisons or metaphors like “it feels like…”." },
      { id: 28, text: "If someone speaks to me harshly or the mood of the place becomes heavy, I tend to carry that feeling with me even after I leave the situation." },
      { id: 29, text: "Having a routine where I repeat the same method or flow many times helps me feel secure and stay focused." },
      { id: 30, text: "While I am studying or learning something, there are moments when scattered pieces of knowledge suddenly connect and I feel I can see the whole picture at once." },

      { id: 31, text: "In my head, I often imagine “what if” situations using sentences, and think ahead about possible outcomes." },
      { id: 32, text: "I can concentrate better on learning or explanations when there are many charts and diagrams, rather than text only." },
      { id: 33, text: "I sometimes replay impressive conversations or lines in my head, together with the atmosphere of that moment, to savor them again." },
      { id: 34, text: "When I talk to someone who accepts my feelings, I feel much lighter even if the problem is not fully solved yet." },
      { id: 35, text: "Using planners or calendars to整理 my schedule and tasks makes me feel that my mind is also becoming more organized." },
      { id: 36, text: "Even if I make detailed plans, I sometimes change direction at the last minute because I sense “this way seems better now”." },

      { id: 37, text: "When something complex happens, I often understand the situation only after I explain my feelings and thoughts to someone in words." },
      { id: 38, text: "When something is explained to me, the layout or diagrams remain in my mind, and I use that mental image later to recall the content." },
      { id: 39, text: "I sometimes see experiences like meetings or farewells as “one chapter” in the story of my life." },
