    // per–type description data
    const typeData = {
      verbal: {
        core: "You naturally think, organize, and explain things through words. Even feelings and abstract ideas become clearer once you turn them into sentences or key phrases. You like to structure information and often play the role of the person who says, “So, in short, this is what it means.”",
        pattern: "Typical phrases for you are things like “So basically…”, “In other words…”, or “To put it simply…”. You often build the whole sentence in your head before speaking, so there can be a short silence before you start talking. Because you explain carefully, some people may feel they are being interrogated or corrected, even when that is not your intention.",
        stress: "You feel strong stress when you are asked to follow decisions that are not explained, or when things change without clear reasons. To release stress, it helps you to write your thoughts in a notebook or to talk them through with someone. You feel the most satisfied when your ideas are clearly organized in words.",
        love: "In relationships, you value sharing thoughts and feelings in words. Rather than vague games, you prefer honest conversations like “This is how I feel now” or “I would appreciate it if you could do this.” You match well with partners who listen calmly and treat your words with care.",
        job: "You tend to do well in work that involves organizing and communicating information in words: writing, editing, planning, customer support, secretarial work, consulting, and so on. You are good at translating complex information into something that others can understand.",
        study: "You learn best by putting things into your own words: writing summaries, explaining to others, or making Q&A style notes. Instead of only reading, you deepen your understanding by asking, “How would I say this myself?”"
      },
      narrative: {
        core: "You understand the world as stories with a flow of time. You connect scattered information into a narrative with a beginning, middle, and end. When you listen to people, you often sense, “What kind of story is this person trying to tell?”",
        pattern: "You often say things like “For example…”, “Let me tell you a story…”, or “Once, this happened…”. Your explanations can become long because you want to include the background and the turning points. For people who only want the key points, this can sometimes feel roundabout.",
        stress: "You feel stressed when you cannot form a meaningful story about what is happening to you. Unfair events or situations that seem meaningless tend to stay in your mind for a long time. On the other hand, when you feel that your past experiences are helping someone, you gain a deep sense of fulfillment.",
        love: "In love, you value “our story” as a couple. You often remember and retell important moments such as the first meeting or a special day. You tend to match well with partners who enjoy looking back on shared memories and building a story together over time.",
        job: "You are suited to work that uses stories to convey meaning: interviewing, writing, teaching, counselling, marketing, presentations, and so on. You are good at organizing complicated situations into a story that moves people’s hearts.",
        study: "Instead of memorizing facts in isolation, you learn better by understanding the background and the “why” behind them. Case studies, examples, and historical stories help you connect new knowledge into a bigger narrative."
      },
      visual: {
        core: "You think in images and structures. Layout, diagrams, colors, and white space catch your eye. You prefer to grasp the whole picture in one image and then adjust the details.",
        pattern: "You tend to use phrases like “If I draw it…”, “Visually speaking…”, or “The layout would be like this.” Because you see images strongly in your mind, it can feel frustrating to explain only with words. Others may not fully understand how clear the picture is for you.",
        stress: "You feel stress when information is presented in a scattered way and you cannot see the structure or relationships. Very messy or crowded spaces also drain your focus. You feel satisfaction when a diagram, slide, or room layout finally “clicks” and everything looks organized.",
        love: "In relationships, you care about the shared atmosphere and visual scene: a nice café, a beautiful view, or a comfortable room. You match well with partners who enjoy creating pleasant spaces together. You also read a lot from facial expressions and body language, not only from words.",
        job: "You are suited to design, illustration, video, UI/UX, slide creation, architecture, product design and other fields where ideas must be turned into visual form. You are strong at making abstract ideas visible and easy to grasp.",
        study: "You learn well with visual tools: charts, mind maps, diagrams, and icons. Using colors and simple drawings in your notes helps the content stay in your memory much longer."
      },
      intuitive: {
        core: "You quickly sense the core of a situation, even when there is a lot of information or uncertainty. A rough overall feeling comes first, and then you build the logic to support it. You are strong at fast decisions and direction-setting.",
        pattern: "You often say things like “I just feel like…”, “My gut says…”, or “I can’t fully explain it, but…”. Inside, you are processing many cues, but from the outside it can look as if you are deciding without reasons. Some people may treat your intuition too lightly.",
        stress: "You feel stressed when you are tightly bound by detailed rules and cannot try things freely. You work best in environments with some freedom and speed. When stress is high, it helps to take a walk, shower, or short break where you empty your mind and let your intuition reset.",
        love: "In love, you value the sense of “This person feels right” more than perfect logic. You focus on the atmosphere and whether you feel relaxed together. You match well with partners who do not question every detail, but instead trust your sense and give you room to move.",
        job: "You are suited to work that requires quick judgment in changing conditions: new business ideas, creative work, consulting, emergency response, and so on. You are good at choosing a direction even when information is incomplete.",
        study: "You learn most effectively by getting a rough overview first and then filling in the details. You tend to grow by learning and trying at the same time rather than waiting until you understand everything perfectly."
      },
      symbolic: {
        core: "You read deeper meaning and themes behind what you see. You understand the world through metaphors and motifs, and you often connect experiences with symbols. You are naturally drawn to deep topics and big questions.",
        pattern: "You may say things like “In other words, this symbolizes…”, or “The theme here is…”. You like to talk about meaning and intention. Others may sometimes feel that you are “thinking too deeply” or making things overly complicated, even when you are simply following your normal way of understanding.",
        stress: "You feel drained in environments driven only by short-term profit or surface-level tasks with no meaning. You gain energy from deep conversations about values, beauty, or purpose. When stress is high, time alone with books, art, or music helps you reconnect with yourself.",
        love: "In relationships, you value symbolism and story: meaningful gifts, special places, or words with personal background. You match well with partners who enjoy talking about values and inner worlds, and who respect your sensitivity rather than dismissing it as “too much”.",
        job: "You are suited to fields where meaning and story matter: writing, poetry, philosophy, art, branding, concept design, and so on. You are strong at designing the message behind an expression or product.",
        study: "You learn best when you ask, “What does this mean for me?” rather than memorizing mechanically. Connecting keywords and building your own conceptual map helps knowledge settle into a personal worldview."
      },
      spatial: {
        core: "You have a strong sense of space, position, and structure. You are sensitive to movement paths, layout, and how things are arranged. In your mind, you often handle information like a 3-D model.",
        pattern: "You tend to use phrases like “In terms of layout…”, “From a structural point of view…”, or “The flow here is not smooth.” Your detailed ideas about space may be misunderstood as being picky or overly particular by people who do not sense those things.",
        stress: "Inefficient layouts, bad traffic flow, or very cluttered spaces cause you stress. You feel satisfied when you can improve a space or system so that people and things move more smoothly. Organizing rooms, tools, or work processes can be a natural way for you to relieve stress.",
        love: "In relationships, you care about daily life together: living space, movement lines in the home, and shared routines. You often judge compatibility by whether you can live comfortably in the same space. You match well with partners who cooperate in designing a practical and comfortable lifestyle.",
        job: "You are suited to architecture, interior design, logistics, process design, event management, operations, and other fields that design space and flow. You are strong at improving how people and objects move through a system.",
        study: "You learn well with models, diagrams, floor plans, and physical objects. Moving things around with your hands—such as building models or rearranging items—helps you understand concepts more deeply."
